# Telecast

Simple, powerful file uploads for Node.js applications. Configure once, and upload from anywhere in your application.

Telecast sets the standard for upload managers by allowing you to:

* Configure the directory and provider where file uploads are stored once, and use that location anywhere in your application

* Forget writing ```mkdirp``` commands, even when streaming, while writing to your local filesystem.

* Upload to multiple cloud storage providers (even at the same time) for redundancy.

* Interact with those providers through the *one true interface for file transfer*... a.k.a. Node Streams.

* Seamlessly integrate streaming multipart-parsers (like [Busboy](http://github.com/mscdex/busboy)) into your application with little or no hassle.

## Usage

### Uploading

```javascript
var fs       = require('fs')
,   telecast = require('telecast');
,   src      = fs.createReadStream(/*...*/)
,   upload   = telecast.put('audio.aiff');

upload.once('success', function (stored) {
  console.log('Success! ' + stored);
});

upload.on('error', function (err) {
  //...
});

src.pipe(upload);
```

### Downloading

```javascript
telecast.get('audio.aiff').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(/*...*/);

```

### Deleting

```javascript
telecast.del('audio.aiff', function (err) {
  //...
});
```
### Configuration

```javascript
telecast.configure({
  aws: {
    key: '',
    secret: '',
    root: 'uploads'
  }
});
```
For detailed usage instructions, see the [Example Application](http://github.com/originalmachine/telecast-example).

## Additional Packages

If you intend to use [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) or [Rackspace Cloud Files](http://rackspace.com/cloud/files), you'll need to require one or more of the following packages:

* [telecast-aws](http://github.com/originalmachine/telecast-aws)

Make sure the relevant packages are in your ```package.json```, and Telecast will do the rest.
